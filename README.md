[MDM9206](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mdm9206-iot-modem) ARM Cortex A7 Up to 1.3 GHz

The MDM9206 LTE modem is designed as a global multi-mode connectivity solution and purpose-built to provide reliable, optimized cellular connectivity for the next-generation of IoT products and services requiring low bandwidth and years of battery-life. The MDM9206 narrowband multi-mode LTE modem combines the high reliability, low latency, and voice support of LTE Cat-M1 (eMTC) with the extended coverage and delay tolerance of Cat NB-1 (NB-IoT), engineered to allow device manufacturers to support ultra-low power consumption and cost-optimized solutions that cover full range of low data rate IoT applications. The inclusion of both technologies as well as E-GPRS along with support of up to 15 global spectrum bands in MDM9206, can allow OEMS to develop products based on single SKU to function in a diverse set of operator deployments worldwide, and thus helping to maximize the IoT products global reach and scalability.


Operating System: ThreadX, Linux
